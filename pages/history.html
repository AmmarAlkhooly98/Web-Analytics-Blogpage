    <h1>A Very Brief Historical Time Line of the Internet & Web Analytics</h1>
    <a href="https://blog.amplitude.com/the-early-days-of-web-analytics#:~:text=1993%3A%20The%20first%20rudimentary%20web,Berners%2DLee%20invented%20the%20internet."> article reference</a>

    <h3>1995: The first log-file analysis program becomes available.</h3>
    <p>Stephen Turner, creates Analog, the first log-file analyzer to show you the “usage patterns on your web server.”
      In this year, Amazon.com, Craigslist, Match.com and eBay go live.

    <h3>1996: More players in the web-analytics market emerge.</h3>
    <p>
      With Analog released just one year prior, the internet becomes accessible to people other than computer scientists. For
      the first time, marketing teams can join in on the action.<br><br>
      
      This creates demand for web-analytics tools that help companies understand and increase traffic. Barriers to entry are
      low, but competition slowly begins to rise. Web-Counter becomes the industry leader in this space, with a specialty in
      counting site visitors (also known as hit counting). Trailing behind are Accrue and Omniture.<br><br>

    <h3>2005: Google Analytics makes its first appearance.</h3>
    <p>
      Over the course of the decade after hit counting is invented, the internet continues to evolve quickly. JavaScript tags
      replace hit counting as the best means of determining website performance.<br><br>
      
      The number of websites grows, resulting in more web analytics companies entering the market. Among these is Urchin,
      which is acquired by Google in 2005 and eventually becomes what we know as Google Analytics.<br><br>

    <h2>The First Appearance of Web Analytics: Hit Counters</h2>
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vrkkgjbn4fsk/4dRtoW1LmRdCAQUgahDbDp/6c25f21a490294e7cd69b8b2ad5a2bfc/image.png"

    <p>
      The debut of web analytics was not exactly glamorous. The first web-analytics tool emerged in the form of “hit
      counters.” Hit counters — also known as web counters — were chunks of code that used a simple PHP script to display an
      image of a number, which incremented every time the script ran. It wasn’t a sophisticated metric and was often kind of
      obtuse, but hit counters were damn easy to use, even if you knew next to nothing about the web. A user could simply
      select a style they wanted from the hit-counter website and then copy-paste the generated code.
